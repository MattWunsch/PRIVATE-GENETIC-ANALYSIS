# Private Genetic Analysis - Video Demonstration Script
## 1-Minute Competition Submission Video

**Total Duration:** 60 seconds

---

## Scene 1: Opening & Problem Statement (0:00 - 0:15)

**Visual:** Title card with project logo, then transition to DNA helix animation with lock icon

**Narrator (Voice-over):**
"Genetic testing reveals our most sensitive health information, but storing DNA data on blockchain has always meant sacrificing privacy. What if we could analyze genetic data on-chain without ever exposing it?"

**On-screen Text:**
- "The Privacy Problem"
- "DNA Data + Blockchain = ?"

## Scene 2: Solution Introduction (0:15 - 0:25)

**Visual:** FHEVM logo animation, then show contract architecture diagram

**Narrator:**
"Introducing Private Genetic Analysis, a fully homomorphic encryption solution built on Zama's FHEVM. This smart contract analyzes encrypted DNA sequences against disease markers while keeping all genetic data completely confidential."

**On-screen Text:**
- "Solution: FHEVM"
- "Analyze encrypted data"
- "Zero data exposure"

## Scene 3: Key Features Demo (0:25 - 0:45)

**Visual:** Screen recording showing:
1. MetaMask wallet connection (2 seconds)
2. DNA sequence submission interface (3 seconds)
3. "Submit Sample" button clicked, transaction pending (2 seconds)
4. "Request Analysis" button activated (2 seconds)
5. Analysis running animation (3 seconds)
6. Encrypted results displayed with risk scores (3 seconds)
7. Access control panel showing lab authorization (3 seconds)
8. Contract statistics dashboard (2 seconds)

**Narrator:**
"Watch how it works: patients submit their DNA sequence, which gets encrypted using FHE operations. The smart contract analyzes this encrypted data against five disease markers using homomorphic comparisons. Risk scores are calculated entirely on encrypted data. Results remain confidential until the patient requests decryption. Authorized research labs can access data with proper permissions, all while maintaining complete genetic privacy."

**On-screen Text (appears sequentially):**
- "1. Submit DNA → Encrypted"
- "2. Analyze → FHE Operations"
- "3. Results → Still Encrypted"
- "4. Decrypt → Patient Control"

## Scene 4: Technical Highlights (0:45 - 0:53)

**Visual:** Code snippets flying in showing:
1. `FHE.asEuint8()` - encryption
2. `FHE.eq()` - comparison
3. `FHE.add()` - arithmetic
4. `FHE.allow()` - access control

**Narrator:**
"Built with comprehensive Hardhat testing, automated documentation generation, and demonstrating essential FHEVM concepts including encrypted comparisons, homomorphic arithmetic, and secure access control patterns."

**On-screen Text:**
- "✓ 100+ Tests"
- "✓ TSDoc Annotations"
- "✓ Full FHEVM Integration"

## Scene 5: Closing & Call to Action (0:53 - 1:00)

**Visual:** GitHub repository page, then return to project logo

**Narrator:**
"Privacy-preserving healthcare on blockchain is now possible. Explore the full implementation, run the tests, and deploy your own instance."

**On-screen Text:**
- "Open Source & MIT Licensed"
- "Built for Zama December 2025 Bounty"
- "GitHub: [Repository URL]"

**Final frame:**
Logo + tagline: "Private Genetic Analysis - Healthcare Privacy Meets Blockchain"

## Production Notes

### Camera/Screen Recording Requirements:
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (Full HD minimum)
- **Frame Rate:** 30fps or 60fps
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)

### Visual Elements Needed:
1. Animated title cards
2. DNA helix animation (stock footage or generated)
3. Screen recording of frontend interaction
4. Code highlighting animations
5. Architecture diagram (create using draw.io or similar)
6. Smooth transitions between scenes

### Audio Requirements:
- **Voice-over:** Clear, professional narration
- **Background Music:** Subtle, modern tech music (royalty-free)
- **Volume:** Music at 20-30%, voice-over at 100%
- **Quality:** 48kHz, stereo

### Editing Guidelines:
- Use smooth transitions (fade, slide)
- Add subtle animations for on-screen text
- Highlight important UI elements with cursor or circles
- Maintain consistent branding colors throughout
- Ensure all text is readable (minimum 24pt font)

### Key Messages to Emphasize:
1. **Privacy:** Genetic data never exposed in plaintext
2. **FHEVM Technology:** Cutting-edge homomorphic encryption
3. **Practical Use Case:** Real-world healthcare application
4. **Complete Implementation:** Tests, docs, frontend all included
5. **Open Source:** Available for community use and learning

## Alternative Shorter Cuts

### 30-Second Version (if needed):
- Problem (7s) → Solution (8s) → Demo (10s) → Close (5s)

### 45-Second Version (if needed):
- Problem (10s) → Solution (10s) → Demo (20s) → Close (5s)

---

## Accessibility Considerations:
- Add closed captions for all narration
- Ensure color contrast for on-screen text
- Use clear, legible fonts
- Provide audio descriptions of visual elements
